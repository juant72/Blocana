# Blocana Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for Blocana, structured in sequential stages. Each stage focuses on specific aspects of the blockchain implementation, allowing for incremental development and testing.

## Overview of Development Stages

| Stage | Focus | Completion Status | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------|------------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Core Components](#stage-1-core-components) | 30% | 1-2 months |
| 2 | [Networking P2P](#stage-2-networking-p2p) | 10% | 2-3 months |
| 3 | [Consensus Mechanism](#stage-3-consensus-mechanism) | 20% | 1-2 months |
| 4 | [Security & Robustness](#stage-4-security--robustness) | 0% | 1-2 months |
| 5 | [Smart Contracts](#stage-5-smart-contracts) | 5% | 3-4 months |
| 6 | [Interfaces & Tools](#stage-6-interfaces--tools) | 0% | 1-2 months |
| 7 | [Optimizations](#stage-7-optimizations) | 0% | 2-3 months |

Total estimated development time: 9-18 months (depending on team size and scope)

## Contributing

For each stage, please refer to the detailed documentation for specific tasks, technical considerations, and implementation guidelines.

Before beginning work on a particular stage, ensure that the previous stages are completed or at least in a stable state, as each stage builds upon the foundations established in the previous ones.
