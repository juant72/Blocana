# Stage 1 Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for Stage 1 core components.

## Unit Tests

### Block Module Tests
- `test_block_creation`: Verify blocks can be created with valid parameters
- `test_block_validation`: Ensure invalid blocks are rejected
- `test_block_serialization`: Test that blocks serialize and deserialize correctly
- `test_merkle_root`: Validate merkle root calculation with different transaction sets

### Transaction Tests
- `test_transaction_signing`: Verify transactions can be properly signed
- `test_transaction_validation`: Ensure signature verification works correctly
- `test_transaction_serialization`: Test binary encoding/decoding

### Storage Tests
- `test_block_storage`: Verify blocks can be saved to and retrieved from storage
- `test_block_by_height`: Ensure blocks can be retrieved by height
- `test_state_storage`: Test saving and retrieving account state
- `test_transaction_indexing`: Verify transactions can be located by hash
- `test_database_recovery`: Test database recovery after simulated crash

### Cryptography Tests
- `test_hash_functions`: Verify SHA-256 implementation against test vectors
- `test_signature_creation`: Test Ed25519 signature generation
- `test_signature_verification`: Validate signature verification logic
- `test_merkle_proof`: Test creation and validation of Merkle proofs

### State Management Tests
- `test_state_transitions`: Verify account state updates correctly after transactions
- `test_state_validation`: Test validity checks for state transitions
- `test_nonce_handling`: Verify nonce validation and increment logic
- `test_balance_updates`: Ensure balances update correctly

## Integration Tests

### End-to-End Transaction Flow
- `test_transaction_lifecycle`: Follow a transaction from creation through validation to inclusion in a block and state update
- `test_multiple_transactions`: Process multiple transactions in a block and verify resulting state

### Chain Construction
- `test_genesis_creation`: Verify genesis block creation and validation
- `test_chain_building`: Test adding multiple blocks to form a chain
- `test_chain_validation`: Validate the entire blockchain from genesis

### Error Conditions
- `test_double_spend`: Attempt a double-spend and verify rejection
- `test_invalid_signatures`: Test handling of transactions with invalid signatures
- `test_future_blocks`: Test blocks with timestamps in the future
- `test_invalid_chain`: Verify detection of invalid block chains

## Performance Tests

### Speed Benchmarks
- `bench_transaction_validation`: Measure transaction validation speed
- `bench_block_validation`: Measure block validation performance
- `bench_merkle_root`: Benchmark Merkle root calculation
- `bench_signature_verification`: Measure signature verification speed

### Resource Usage
- `test_memory_usage`: Monitor memory consumption during operations
- `test_storage_size`: Measure storage requirements for blockchain data
- `test_cpu_usage`: Profile CPU usage during intensive operations

### Scalability Tests
- `test_large_blocks`: Test processing blocks with many transactions
- `test_chain_growth`: Measure performance as the blockchain grows
- `test_many_accounts`: Test performance with a large number of accounts

## Fuzzing and Edge Case Tests

### Fuzzing
- Implement property-based testing for transaction validation
- Fuzz block headers with randomly generated values
- Generate and test random transaction sequences

### Edge Cases
- Test with minimum and maximum values for all numeric fields
- Test empty blocks and transactions
- Test blocks with exactly one transaction
- Test transactions that exactly consume available balance

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Utilities
- Mock transaction generator
- Block builder utility
- Test wallet implementation
- Chain validator helper
- State snapshot utilities

### Test Database
- In-memory database implementation for tests
- Test fixtures for common scenarios
- Database reset functionality between tests

## Manual Testing

### Exploratory Testing
- Manual verification of blockchain consistency
- Ad-hoc transaction and block creation testing
- Deliberate error injection and recovery testing

### Setup Instructions
- Database initialization procedures for testing
- Environment configuration requirements
- Test data preparation steps

## Test Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- Track unit test coverage percentage
- Identify uncovered code paths
- Set minimum coverage requirements (target: 85%)

### Performance Baselines
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Define acceptable performance thresholds
- Document performance test environment specifications

### Test Schedule
- Define timing for running different test suites
- Establish regression testing requirements
- Set up continuous integration test schedule

## Conclusion

The testing strategy outlined above provides comprehensive coverage of Blocana's Stage 1 core components. By executing this test plan, we can ensure the reliability, correctness, and performance of the fundamental blockchain functionality before proceeding to subsequent development stages.
