# Stage 1 Implementation Plan

This document provides a structured plan for implementing Stage 1 of Blocana, breaking down the work into sequential milestones with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria.

## Overview

Stage 1 will be implemented in 5 milestones, with each milestone building on the previous one:

1. **Core Data Structures**
2. **Cryptographic Implementation**
3. **Storage Layer**
4. **Transaction Management**
5. **Genesis & Chain Validation**

## Milestone 1: Core Data Structures

**Timeframe**: 1-2 weeks

### Tasks
1. Implement `Block` and `BlockHeader` structs
2. Implement `Transaction` struct
3. Create basic blockchain state structures
4. Implement serialization/deserialization

### Dependencies
- None (this is the first milestone)

### Acceptance Criteria
- All structs properly implement traits: `Clone`, `Debug`, etc.
- Serialization tests pass for all data structures
- Memory footprint within expected bounds

## Milestone 2: Cryptographic Implementation

**Timeframe**: 1-2 weeks

### Tasks
1. Implement SHA-256 hashing utilities
2. Implement Ed25519 signature generation and verification
3. Create Merkle tree implementation
4. Add cryptographic validation functions

### Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Core Data Structures)

### Acceptance Criteria
- All cryptographic operations match test vectors
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- Security tests pass

## Milestone 3: Storage Layer

**Timeframe**: 2-3 weeks

### Tasks
1. Set up RocksDB integration
2. Implement block storage and retrieval
3. Create state storage mechanisms
4. Implement indexing for efficient queries

### Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Core Data Structures)
- Milestone 2 (Cryptographic Implementation)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Data persists across application restarts
- Read/write operations meet performance targets
- Storage size remains within expected bounds
- Basic recovery mechanisms function correctly

## Milestone 4: Transaction Management

**Timeframe**: 1-2 weeks

### Tasks
1. Implement transaction pool
2. Create transaction validation logic
3. Add fee prioritization mechanism
4. Implement transaction selection for blocks

### Dependencies
- Milestone 1 (Core Data Structures)
- Milestone 2 (Cryptographic Implementation)
- Milestone 3 (Storage Layer)

### Acceptance Criteria
- Transaction pool correctly manages pending transactions
- Fee-based prioritization works as expected
- Duplicate and invalid transactions are rejected
- Memory usage remains within bounds even with many transactions

## Milestone 5: Genesis & Chain Validation

**Timeframe**: 1-2 weeks

### Tasks
1. Implement genesis block creation
2. Create full chain validation logic
3. Implement account balance tracking
4. Add comprehensive testing

### Dependencies
- Milestone 1-4

### Acceptance Criteria
- Genesis block is created correctly
- Chain validation correctly identifies valid and invalid chains
- Account balances are tracked accurately
- All unit and integration tests pass

## Testing Strategy

Each milestone includes:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Fuzzing for error conditions

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Performance issues with RocksDB | High | Medium | Early benchmarking, alternative DB options |
| Cryptographic vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Extensive testing, use of established libraries |
| Memory usage exceeds targets | High | Medium | Continuous profiling, incremental optimization |
| Storage growth faster than expected | Medium | Medium | Implement early monitoring, prepare pruning strategy |
| Serialization format issues | Medium | Low | Extensive testing with edge cases |

## Resources Required

- 1-2 Backend developers with Rust experience
- 1 Developer with cryptography expertise
- Testing environment with various hardware profiles
- Benchmarking tools
